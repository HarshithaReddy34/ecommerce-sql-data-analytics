**Zepto SQL Data Analysis Project**

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce inventory data from Zepto using SQL. It demonstrates how a data analyst can clean, explore, and generate insights from real-world datasets similar to those used in retail and e-commerce companies.

**Project Overview:**

The goal of this project is to simulate how analysts use SQL to:
Create and manage a database for an e-commerce inventory.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand product and pricing information.
Clean and prepare data by handling missing or inconsistent values.
Write SQL queries to extract meaningful business insights about pricing, inventory, and product performance.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle - Zepto Inventory Dataset.
It contains detailed information about Zepto’s product listings, including pricing, category, and availability data.

**Key columns include:**

sku_id: Unique identifier for each product
